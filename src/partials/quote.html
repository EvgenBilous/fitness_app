        The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of
        moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week for
        adults aged 18-64. However, what happens if we adjust that number to 110
        minutes every day? While it might seem like a high number to hit,
        dedicating 110 minutes daily to sporting activities may offer
        unparalleled benefits to physical health, mental well-being, and overall
        quality of life.
